### Local Development

**Dependencies**

- Deno
- Sass

To compile the project run:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will generate the appropriate files in the `/dist` directory. The files to serve exist in dist. It's plain old static HTML so you can view the site at `path/to/ztalks/dist/index.html`.

> Note: May need to manually create a `/dist` folder if none exists
