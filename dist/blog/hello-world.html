        Yes, yet another tech blog. I've delayed starting this for
        <i>years</i> now because I never thought I had anything interesting to
        share and the interwebs can be a pretty rough space. I still don't think
        I have anything particularly interesting to say and the internet hasn't
        gotten any nicer, but here we are.
      </p>

      <p>
        By trade I'm a software engineer building stuff on the Web. As of late
        however, I've been getting more into everything <i>except for web</i> -
        systems programming in Rust, sustainability, computer graphics, video
        game development and machine learning. On that end, a lot of future
        posts will likely chronicle how I stumble through these various topics.
        I'll do my best to keep entries about software engineering, career
        advancement and technology in general, but who knows what I'll rant
        about. Believe it or not, I have various interests outside of machines
        such as surfing, traveling, and eating damn good food (yeah really
        original) so these may sneak in as well. Hopefully readers find
        something in here useful. If not, whatever, stop procrastinating and go
        read a book or work on your startup.
      </p>

      <p>
        For starters, and to not make this a complete waste of a blog post,
        let's explore how this simple blog site was built. You can find the

      <h2>Javascript frameworks everywhere</h2>

      <p>
        I admit it - I come from a Javascript framework focused background. When
        I was really first starting off <i>AngularJs</i> was still en vogue with
        <i>React</i> only starting to gain traction. These libraries have
        nurtured a whole sector of software engineering in "frontend
        development" by allowing devs to seemlessly weave together their HTML,
        CSS, and Javascript logic (or Typescript if you're lucky). The result is
        we have a generous amount of extremely complex web applications. Some
        programs that have traditionally been reserved for the <i>C++</i> crowd,
        such as video games, are now portable and playable on in the Browser.
        It's definitely been an exciting time to develop on the web but it does
        come with its faults. One of which is with the proliferation of these JS
        libraries it seems the default is to reach for frameworks in all cases,
        even when they're not needed. For a blog site such as this one it would
        be plain silly to immediately reach for <i>Svelte</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I realize we're starting to come full circle and <i>SSR</i> is popular
        and <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> (and others) promise a
        lot. But in many scenarios these feel like we're throwing more
        technology at a problem that is only a problem because of the underlying
        technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        Based off the sites that I visit frequently throughout my day, I'd argue
        that the vast majority could be implemented as mostly static HTML pages.
        What's further, is many of them probably don't even need to build a
        custom API server that a <i>Go</i> developer felt was needed. Instead,
        <i>Keep It Simple, Stupid</i> - use static HTML and slap those guys on
        something simple like
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/">AWS Amplify</a>. This is
        exactly how this blog works.
      </p>

      <div class="blog__page-break"></div>

      <p>
        One of the most important contributions these javascript frameworks have
        helped promote is the use of the Component architecture - the now
        ubiquitous idea where complex UIs can be broken down into smaller
        sub-problems. This model works great in the Web as the DOM already takes
        this approach with each Element being their own isolated units that can
        be composed together to form the whole application. The part that is
        missing in native HTML, and where frameworks have helped fill in the
        gaps, is when we need to reuse a composition of these basic elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a site that has multiple HTML pages, such as this blog, there is
        potentially a lot of repetitive boilerplate in setting up all the
        top-level tags (<code class="blog__code">html</code>,
        <code class="blog__code">head</code>, etc). Additionally, we naturally
        will have repeatable complex modules such as <i>navbars</i> and
        <i>footers</i> that appear on all these pages. Instead of having to
        redeclare all that repeated markeup everywhere, wouldn't it be
        incredible to abstract these modules into our own HTML custom
        elements/components?
      </p>

      <h2>Introducing the <code class="blog__code">&lt;z&gt;</code> tag</h2>

      <p>
        It turns out we can get all the benefits of components without having to
        bring in javascript frameworks - we just have to build it!
      </p>

      <pre class="code"><code>
  <span class="comment">// index.html</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;z</span> component=<span class="string">"blog"</span><span class="var-name">&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;div&gt;</span>blah blah blah<span class="var-name">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;/z&gt;</span>

</code></pre>

      <p>
        I created a new synthetic HTML tag which, with a little help from
        Javascript, can define some custom behavior. In this case, we say that
        we want to render the <code class="blog__code">blog</code> component
        (similar to how you would with any other native element tag). Why name
        it <code class="blog__code">&lt;z&gt;</code>? Because I'm unoriginal.
        Also note that these are <i>not</i> Web Components - I'll mention that
        further down.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now say our <code class="blog__code">blog</code> component looked as
        follows:
      </p>

      <pre class="code"><code>
  <span class="comment">// blog.html</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;article</span><span class="var-name">&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;h3&gt;</span>A Blog Title<span class="var-name">&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;z</span> yield<span class="var-name"></span><span class="var-name">&gt;&lt;/z&gt;</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;/article&gt;</span>

</code></pre>

      <p>
        This defines a simple <i>Blog</i> component that can be reused throught
        our site. For our exmaple, this blog markup will replace the
        <code class="blog__code">&lt;z&gt;</code> element that is defined in
        <code class="blog__code">index.html</code>. Also pay notice to that
        <code class="blog__code">yield</code> attribute. This is something
        inspired by
        <a href="https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/yield?anchor=yield">EmberJs</a>
        where the child elements of the consuming component will be transfused
        into the yield template. Sounds confusing? It's really not, and is
        probably better seen though examples - here's the result!
      </p>

      <pre class="code"><code>
  <span class="comment">// dist/index.html</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;article</span><span class="var-name">&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;h3&gt;</span>A Blog Title<span class="var-name">&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;div&gt;</span>blah blah blah<span class="var-name">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;/article&gt;</span>

</code></pre>

      <p><i>Pretty cool!</i></p>

      <p>
        I've extended this further to allow <i>very basic</i> data passing
        (props) to help make components more customizable and reusable. With
        some small changes we can do even cooler things, like providing a
        <code class="blog__code">blog-title</code>:
      </p>

      <pre class="code"><code>
  <span class="comment">// index.html</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;z</span> component=<span class="string">"blog"</span> blog-title=<span class="string">"React who?"</span><span class="var-name">&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;div&gt;</span>blah blah blah<span class="var-name">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;/z&gt;</span>

  <span class="comment">// blog.html</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;article</span><span class="var-name">&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;h3&gt;</span><span class="string">&lt;%</span> blog-title <span class="string">%&gt;</span><span class="var-name">&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;z</span> yield<span class="var-name">&gt;</span><span class="var-name">&lt;/z&gt;</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;/article&gt;</span>

  <span class="comment">// dist/index.html</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;article</span><span class="var-name">&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;h3&gt;</span>React who?<span class="var-name">&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;div&gt;</span>blah blah blah<span class="var-name">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;/article&gt;</span>
  
</code></pre>

      <p>
        The best part about all of this is the resulting markup is generated
        ahead of time in a build/compile step - there's no Javascript working
        behind the scenes! No scripts on the server and nothing on the client -
        the build produces the final static HTML files that are to be served.
        And as I mentioned earlier, this means there's no need to wrangle a web
        server of our own, and I can instead use a "cheap" static site hosting
        service. It's like partying in 1995.
      </p>

      <h2>Closing remarks</h2>

      <p>
        There's obviously things missing in my little library that would be nice
        to have, namely a control-flow mechanism to conditionally render
        elements. It also seems trivial to extend the library such that it
        allows consumers to define their own custom
        <code class="blog__code">&lt;z&gt;</code> element attributes. Who knows,
        maybe with a little motivation this will eventually become
        Turing-complete.
      </p>

      <p>
        I guess I have to cover my butt and mention that I'm aware that things
        like <a href="https://ejs.co/">EJS</a> exist that do pretty much what I
        built (well okay, those template libraries are better and do much more).
        But for my uses these templates still felt to be more powerful than what
        I needed. For now, I don't really want a Javascript server nor do I need
        to run any scripts on the client to "build" dynamic markup. I did not
        reach for Web Components for these same reasons. As the site evolves and
        I inevitably add useless features with bloated javascript, I may
        reconsider and move to full components. For now, I have an itch to
        scratch for diving into an
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5dMEP_BbI&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3">excellent Youtube series</a>
        on Neural Networks.
