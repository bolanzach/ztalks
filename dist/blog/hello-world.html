        Yes, yet another tech blog. I'll do my best to keep this about
        technology in general, software engineering, etc. but who knows what
        I'll rant about. For starters, let's see how this simple blog was made!
      </p>

      <h3>Javascript everywhere</h3>

      <p>
        I admit it - I come from a Javascript framework focused background. When
        I was really first starting off <i>AngularJs</i> was still en vogue with
        <i>React</i> only starting to gain traction. As such, the way I think
        about web UIs is through Components. The component model is an excellent
        abstraction and checks all the boxes for composability and reusability.
        These libraries have nurtured a whole sector of software engineering in
        "frontend development" by allowing devs to seemlessly weave together
        their HTML, CSS, and Javascript logic (or Typescript if you're lucky).
        The result is we have a generous amount of extremely complex web
        applications. However, as been stressed many times, frameworks are not
        the silver bullet that our industry makes us think they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm using this blog as the prime example - there is no need for an
        entire framework. Just like the good 'ol days, it's a mostly static
        website that's nicely separated by individual pages that can all be
        navigated to. By shedding all the Javascript
      </p>

      <p>
        While I resist to use a framework, I concede that the Component model is
        powerfull. As mentioned earlier, there is a lot to gain and components
        could help streamline building and (more importantly) maintaining the
        blog. How awesome would it be that instead of having to redeclare all
        the <code>HTML</code> boilerplate for each page, we could just use a
        resuable Tag or Component?
      </p>

      <h3>Introducing the <code>&lt;z&gt;</code> tag</h3>

      <p>
        It turns out we can get all the benefits of components without having to
        bring in frameworks - we just have to build it!
      </p>

      <pre class="code"><code>
  <span class="comment">// index.html</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;z</span> component=<span class="string">"blog"</span><span class="var-name">&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;div&gt;</span>blah blah blah&lt;<span class="var-name">/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;/z&gt;</span>

</code></pre>

      <p>
        I created a new synthetic HTML tag which, with a little help from
        Javascript, can define some custom behavior. In this case, we say that
        we want to render the <code>blog</code> component (similar to how you
        would with any other native element tag).
      </p>

      <p>Now say our <code>layout</code> component looked as follows:</p>

      <pre class="code"><code>
  <span class="comment">// blog.html</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;article</span><span class="var-name">&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;h3&gt;</span>A Blog Title&lt;<span class="var-name">/h3&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;z</span> yield<span class="var-name">&gt;</span><span class="var-name">&lt;/z&gt;</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;/article&gt;</span>

</code></pre>

      <p>
        This defines a simple <i>Blog</i> component that can be reused throught
        our site. For our exmaple, this layout markup will replace the
        <code>&lt;z&gt;</code> element. Also pay notice to that
        <code>yield</code> attribute. This is something inspired by EmberJs
        where the child elements of the consuming component will be transfused
        into the yield statement. This is best explained though examples, so our
        end result is:
      </p>

      <pre class="code"><code>
  <span class="comment">// dist/index.html</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;article</span><span class="var-name">&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;h3&gt;</span>A Blog Title&lt;<span class="var-name">/h3&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;div&gt;</span>blah blah blah&lt;<span class="var-name">/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;/article&gt;</span>

</code></pre>

      <p>Pretty cool!</p>

      <p>
        I've extend this further to allow <i>very basic</i> data passing (props)
        to help make components more customizable and reusable. With some small
        changes we can do even cooler things:
      </p>

      <pre class="code"><code>
  <span class="comment">// index.html</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;z</span> component=<span class="string">"blog"</span> blog-title=<span class="string">"React who?"</span><span class="var-name">&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;div&gt;</span>blah blah blah&lt;<span class="var-name">/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;/z&gt;</span>

  <span class="comment">// blog.html</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;article</span><span class="var-name">&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;h3&gt;</span><span class="string">&lt;%</span> blog-title <span class="string">%&gt;</span><span class="var-name">/h3&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;z</span> yield<span class="var-name">&gt;</span><span class="var-name">&lt;/z&gt;</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;/article&gt;</span>

  <span class="comment">// dist/index.html</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;article</span><span class="var-name">&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;h3&gt;</span>React who?&lt;<span class="var-name">/h3&gt;</span>
    <span class="var-name">&lt;div&gt;</span>blah blah blah&lt;<span class="var-name">/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="var-name">&lt;/article&gt;</span>
  
</code></pre>
    </div>
  </main>
