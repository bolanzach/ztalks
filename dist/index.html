        <h2 class="util__no-header-bottom">About Me</h2>
        <div class="util__small-divider util__mb2"></div>
    
        <p>
            I’m a Tech-Lead experienced fullstack Web software engineer based out of Venice, California, just a few blocks from the Breakwater<a href="https://westsidelosangeles.com/visitor-guide-venice-breakwater.php"> 🏄🏻‍♂️</a>. My modus operandi is 
            working at a higher level of abstraction; leading, mentoring, and challenging others, while jumping into the most 
            difficult challenges when needed. The problems that I'm enjoying solving revolve around <i>Teams</i>, <i>Culture</i>, and <i>Scale</i>. 
            I empower my engineering team:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>To continuously imporove themselves, both personally and professionally</li>
            <li>To architect systems and drive innovation that <i>directly bring value to our users</i></li>
            <li>To have fun. Life is too short not to enjoy what we're doing</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            I’m currently spending a significant amount of my energy and time 
            launching <a href="https://herdbuy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERDBUY ⇲</a> - an E-commerce 
            website, with a twist, that gives power back to the buyer. This 
            is as close to a startup from a garage as it gets, with a few college friends trying to build something 
            cool (we’re all remote, renting physical garages in California is expensive!). As the founding and lead 
            engineer, I’ve bootstrapped the majority of the app and am responsible for every significant technical 
            decision. While definitely a grind, it’s honestly been refreshing to be laser focused on the product and 
            trying to invent something that brings value to buyers and sellers. We’re on track to launch by the end of April 
            2024 so stay tuned!
        </p>

        <h4 class="util__no-header-bottom">Other Interests 👾 🤖 ♻️</h4>

        <p>
            I have nearly nine years experience in full-stack web development. However, more recently, I’ve been 
            enjoying moving from this domain and getting <i>“closer to the metal”</i> by doing a little more systems 
            engineering with C++ and Rust. I’ve always been creative (I was originally a Fine Arts major) which 
            has led me to build a simulation/game engine from scratch. This may never amount to much, but it’s 
            really more of <i>“about the friends you made along the way”</i> kind of project.
        </p>

        <p>
            Like any self respecting software engineer these days, I’ve also been dabbling in AI. At present, 
            I’m passionate about seeing how we can leverage these tools, like my simulation engine, and pair 
            it with <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08751.pdf">generative AI</a> to empower creatives. I believe there is enormous opportunity in closing the 
            gap between ideation and concept, to a tangible piece of work.
        </p>

        <p>
            And lastly, I care deeply about our environment and the future of our planet. <b>I believe mitigating a 
            climate crisis is one the most pressing issue of our time.</b> While finding, adoptiong, and transitioning to cleaner and renewable sources
            of energy is a major component, it's a multi-faceted challenge as solutions will 
            need to come in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Avoid_a_Climate_Disaster">many forms</a> - technical, 
            policy, and behavioral. I'm currently exploring opportunities for how I can use my skills to attack the issue and be
            a part of the solution.

        <h5>Learning the basics of not just software engineering, but learning how I work effectively.</h5>

        <p>
            I started my career off in Washington DC as a full-stack engineer at <a href="https://www.researchinnovations.com/">Research Innovations</a>. 
            I made a lot of mistakes, and then made some more. This is where I was first introduced to frontend 
            frameworks and consequently built a lot in AngularJS and then React.
        </p>

        <p>
            Being such a small company, I had the advantage of being involved
            in many decisions and really learned how software systems are built. Some key highlights:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Introduced modern tooling to the UI codebase, such as ES2015</li>
            <li>Built the UIs and APIs for complex networked graph and time series visualizations</li>
            <li>Helped migrate the legacy system to React by building the underlying component framework</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            By the time I moved on to my next role I was leading some small teams and projects, giving 
            me a taste for what would come later.
        </p>

        <h5>Learning software engineering at scale - how the big dogs work.</h5>

        <p>
            For my next play I was looking to really challenge myself and take things to the next level - and that's how I ended up at 
            LinkedIn, largely as a frontend engineer. I was on a 
            high-performing team building out <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/talent-insights">Talent Insights</a>, 
            and then eventually moving over to work on various 
            <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/linkedin-hiring-integrations/ats-integrations">
            Recruiter features</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I onboarded my team onto LinkedIn’s notification system, a multi-quarter effort of designing and implementation that 
            had me working with multiple different teams across the entire tech stack from Ember, Java, HDFS, and Kafka. The infrastructure
            I built was in support of a machine learning anomoly detection engine that surfaces important events, such as 
            when a company experiences layoffs. My work was the template for the team and allowed future notifications and alerts to be iterated
            on quickly. Additionally, I:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Built the APIs that consumed anomaly events and the UIs to display them in-app
            </li>
            <li>
                Evangelized migrating to Octane and advocated for modern practices by putting them into practice. We were one of the first teams at LinkedIn to release 
                customer facing products using the new framework
            </li>
            <li>
                Designed a shareable read-only view of Talent Insights
            </li>
            <li>
                Built some of the first underlying React components for Recruiter. These components represented the core building blocks,
                such as buttons, icons, lists, etc. that would be used by future React apps
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Above all, my experience at LinkedIn taught me about <i>scale</i>. I'm not just talking about building systems 
            for millions of users, but how to design systems and write code for an audience of 
            hundreds of Engineers. And even more importantly, I learned how to effectively communicate, work with, and get buy in from these
            hundereds of Engineers, Designers, and Product Managers, all across the globe.

        <h5>Taking control of the helm.</h5>

        <p>
            Currently, I sit as a Principal Software Engineer at <a href="https://videoamp.com/">VideoAmp</a>. I am the Typescript Node
            subject matter expert, though I've worked extensively across the tech stack with React, Go, Postgres and Kafka.
        </p>

        <h4 class="util__no-header-bottom">As a Senior Software Engineer</h4>
        <p>
            I successfully evangelized and 
            then led the effort to re-architect Node microservices to meet the increase in load and quality expectations on the systems
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Led and mentored a team that grew from four engineers to over a dozen
            </li>
            <li>
                Designed and built a new Node API that introduced stronger typings, a tighter architecture, and model validation
            </li>
            <li>
                Gave frequent talks to promote best practices and advocate for Typescript APIs 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The new system was delivered with zero downtime to users and we appraoched zero runtime alerts in the service when 
            deployed. Shortly after, I was a Tech Lead on a separate project for 
            <a href="https://videoamp.com/press/videoamp-to-measure-deduplicated-youtube-reach-and-frequency/">measuring YouTube</a> 
            that was to be built on top of the new system. Again the team was able to move fast and deliver with no user-facing issues - 
            proof that the new services were a success.
        </p>

        <h4 class="util__no-header-bottom">As a Principal Software Engineer</h4>
        <p>
            I took the learnings from those APIs and built new services which onboarded Typescript into the organization's 
            Bazel build system, where I focused on <i>creating the best developer experience imaginable</i>. Meanwhile, 
            this effort was really ancillary - I was leading a team to design and launch a report templating engine 
            that would need to be built using these new tools. In three months I achieved both:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Typescript became a first-class supported programming language where I integrated 
                GRPC, static database types, model validation, and integrated into the release pipelines
            </li>
            <li>
                The engine was released on these new tools
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            More recently, I've been a 
            Tech Lead for a team of six engineers where I was responsible for all Scrum ceremonies, architecture, scoping,
            and project planning. My day was largely spent mentoring and unblocking the team through relentlessly improving processes, and I 
            mostly got my hands dirty on the most difficult technical problems and designs.
        </p>

        <p>
            This has been the most rewarding
            period of my career thus far. It's addictive to witness the team learn and grow, and I'm satisfied with how
            the decisions I make are impacting the engineering organization as a whole.
        </p>

        <p>
            As of late, I've been looking into how the company can adopt HTMX and OpenAPI tooling to power a Developer Portal for
            external API consumers. This includes pushsing for the entire company to adpot RESTful API stadnards, defining our API lifecycle, and
            advocating for API Evolution.
