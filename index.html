        <p>
            Hey, I’m Zach Bolan. My <a href="./resume.pdf">resume</a> has the abbreviated version. This is the 
            longer-form as I don’t believe two pages of bullet points can properly sum up who I am or how I work. 
            If you're looking for a little more narrative then hopefully you find this to be helpful!
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Are you working on something <i>ambitous</i> and interested in working with me? Feel free to <a href="mailto:bolanzach@gmail.com">say hello!</a>

            I’m a tech-lead experienced software engineer based out of Venice, California. My modus operandi is 
            working at a higher level of abstraction, leading and mentoring others, but jumping into the most 
            difficult problems when needed. I’m currently spending a significant amount of my energy and time 
            launching <b>herdbuy.com</b> - an e-commerce website, with a twist, that gives power back to the buyer. This 
            is as close to a startup from a garage as it gets, with a few college friends trying to build something 
            cool (we’re all remote, renting physical garages in California is expensive!). As the founding and lead 
            engineer, I’ve bootstrapped the majority of the app and am responsible for every significant technical 
            decision. While definitely a grind, it’s honestly been refreshing to be laser focused on the product and 
            trying to invent something that brings value to buyers and sellers. We’re on track to launch February 
            2024 so stay tuned!

            I have nearly nine years experience in full-stack web development. However, more recently, I’ve been 
            enjoying moving from this domain and getting <i>“closer to the metal”</i> by doing a little more systems 
            engineering with C++ and Rust. I’ve always been creative (I was originally a Fine Arts major) which 
            has led me to build a simulation/game engine from scratch. This may never amount to much, but it’s 
            really more of <i>“about the friends you made along the way”</i> kind of project.
        </p>

        <p>
            Like any self respecting software engineer these days, I’ve also been dabbling in AI. At present, 
            I’m passionate about seeing how we can leverage these tools, like the simulation engine, and pair 
            it with generative AI to empower creatives. I believe there is enormous opportunity in closing the 
            gap between ideation and concept, to a tangible piece of work.

        <h4 class="util__no-header-bottom">RESEARCH INNOVATIONS <i>(July 2015 — Nov 2018)</i></h4>
        <h5>Learning the basics of not just software engineering, but learning how I work effectively</h5>

        <p>
            I started my career off in Washington DC as a full-stack engineer at <a href="https://www.researchinnovations.com/">Research Innovations</a>. 
            I made a lot of mistakes and then made some more. This is where I was first introduced to frontend 
            frameworks and consequently built a lot in AngularJS and then React. Being such a small company I was involved
            in many decisions and really learned how software systems are built. I introduced modern tooling to the
            UI codebase, built various Java APIs, worked on graph databases, and helped migrate and build the framework
            for the new React frontend. By the time I moved on to my next role I was leading some small teams and projects, giving 
            me a taste for what would come later.

        <h4 class="util__no-header-bottom">LINKEDIN <i>(Dec 2018 — Aug 2021)</i></h4>
        <h5>Learning software engineering at scale - how the big dogs work</h5>

        <p>
            My next play was to really challenge myself and take things to the next level - thus I ended up at 
            LinkedIn, largely as a frontend engineer. I was on a 
            high-performing team building out <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/talent-insights">Talent Insights</a>, 
            and then eventually moving over to work on various 
            <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/linkedin-hiring-integrations/ats-integrations">
            Recruiter features</a> - including the first Typescript React application at the company. Perhaps most 
            interestingly, I onboarded our team onto LinkedIn’s notification system, a multi-quarter effort that 
            had me working across Java, HDFS, Kafka, and more. I layed the foundation for our team so that all future 
            notifications followed my template and could be iterated on quickly. Additionally, I helped evangelize 
            migrating to Octane by putting it into practice and being some of the first teams to release customer
            facing features with the new framework. Above all, my experience at LinkedIn taught me about scale. 
            And not just about system usage scale, but how to design systems and write code for an audience of 
            hundreds of engineers, and even more importantly, how to communicate and get buy-in from people across 
            the globe.

        <h5>Taking control of the helm</h5>

        <p>
            Currently, I sit as a Principal Software Engineer at <a href="https://videoamp.com/">VideoAmp</a>. I’ve worked on various initiatives over 
            the years from UI data viz, database design, sprinkles of DevOps, etc. But over time I’ve become the 
            Typescript subject matter expert, especially when it relates to Node and APIs. Early on, I successfully evangelized and 
            then led the effort to re-architect our Node microservices to meet the increasing demands on our systems. 
            I did this by leading a team that grew from four engineers to over a dozen, mentoring and upskilling the team 
            so that we could deliver with no downtime for our users, and nearly zero runtime alerts on the new system. 
            Our project became the template for which all new future Typescript APIs would follow.
            Shortly after, I was a tech lead for an initiative to 
            <a href="https://videoamp.com/press/videoamp-to-measure-deduplicated-youtube-reach-and-frequency/">measure YouTube</a>, 
            which was built on top of the new system.
        </p>
        <p>
            I then took the learnings from those APIs and built new services which onboarded Typescript into our 
            Bazel build system, where I focused on creating the best developer experience imaginable. Meanwhile, 
            this effort was really ancillary - I was leading a team to design and launch a report templating engine 
            that would need to be built using these new tools. In a matter of months, I achieved both - Typescript 
            became a first-class supported programming language, where I integrated 
            GRPC, static database types, model validation, integrated into our release pipelines, and more. And 
            our engine was successfully shipped.
