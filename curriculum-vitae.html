            Hey, I&#39;m Zach Bolan. My <a href="./resume.pdf">resume</a> has the abbreviated version. This is the 
            longer-form as I don&#39;t believe two pages of bullet points can properly sum up who I am or how I work. 
            If you&#39;re looking for a little more narrative, then hopefully you find this to be helpful!

        <h2 class="util__no-header-bottom">About Me</h2>
        <div class="util__small-divider util__mb2"></div>
    
        <p>
            I&#39;m a Tech-Lead experienced fullstack Web software engineer based out of Venice, California, just a few blocks from the Breakwater<a href="https://westsidelosangeles.com/visitor-guide-venice-breakwater.php"> üèÑüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</a>. My modus operandi is 
            working at a higher level of abstraction; leading, mentoring, and challenging others, while jumping into the most 
            difficult problems when needed. The problems that I&#39;m enjoying solving revolve around <i>Teams</i>, <i>Culture</i>, and <i>Scale</i>.
            I empower my engineering team:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>To continuously improve themselves, both personally and professionally</li>
            <li>To design systems and drive innovation that <i>directly bring value to our users</i></li>
            <li>To have fun. Life is too short not to enjoy what we&#39;re doing</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            I am currently spending a significant amount of my energy and time 
            launching <a href="https://herdbuy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERDBUY &#8690;</a> - an E-commerce 
            website, with a twist, that gives power back to the buyer. This 
            is as close to a startup from a garage as it gets, with a few college friends trying to build something 
            cool (we&#39;re all remote, renting physical garages in California is expensive!). As the founding and lead 
            engineer, I&#39;ve bootstrapped the majority of the app and am responsible for every significant technical 
            decision. While definitely a grind, it&#39;s honestly been refreshing to be laser focused on the product and 
            trying to invent something that brings value to buyers and sellers. We had a soft launch in June where we
            learned a lot, and have now officially launched in late July 2024!
        </p>

        <h4 class="util__no-header-bottom">Other Interests üåê</h4>

        <p>
            While I have nearly a decade of experience in Web development I have spent time working around computer graphics and video games.
            I&#39;ve always been visually inclined (I was originally a Fine Arts major) and so tinkering in this area just feels natural.
            I also enjoy building things for builders, which is why I probably always end up building an <i>engine</i> rather than actually creating a game.
            And like any self-respecting engineer these, days I have done some work in Machine Learning.
            I&#39;m passionate about seeing how ML can empower, not replace, creatives and builders.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also care deeply about our environment and the future of our planet.
            <b>I believe mitigating a climate crisis is one of the most pressing issues of our time.</b>
            This is why I have moved my career into focusing on Climate, specifically into applying software and technology to meet the needs of our planet.
            I&#39;m a <a href="https://www.climatebase.org/">Climatebase</a> Fellow where I am currently deeply exploring the issues faced by the people and builders in the Climate space.
            There is tremendous opportunity to make an immense impact and I&#39;m hopeful that I sit at the intersection of the Web, computer graphics, ML, and Climate.

        <h5>Learning the basics of not just software engineering, but learning how I work effectively.</h5>

        <p>
            I started my career off in Washington DC as a full-stack engineer at <a href="https://www.researchinnovations.com/">Research Innovations</a>. 
            I made a lot of mistakes, and then made some more. This is where I was first introduced to frontend 
            frameworks and consequently built a lot in AngularJS and then React.
        </p>

        <p>
            Being such a small company, I had the advantage of being involved
            in many decisions and really learned how software systems are built. Some key highlights:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Introduced modern tooling to the UI codebase, such as ES2015</li>
            <li>Built the UIs and APIs for complex networked graph and time series visualizations</li>
            <li>Helped migrate the legacy system to React by building the underlying component framework</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            By the time I moved on to my next role I was leading some small teams and projects, giving 
            me a taste for what would come later.
        </p>

        <h5>Learning software engineering at scale - how the big dogs work.</h5>

        <p>
            For my next play I was looking to really challenge myself and take things to the next level - and that&#39;s how I ended up at 
            LinkedIn, largely as a frontend engineer. I was on a 
            high-performing team building out <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/talent-insights">Talent Insights</a>, 
            and then eventually moving over to work on various 
            <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/linkedin-hiring-integrations/ats-integrations">
            Recruiter features</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I onboarded my team onto LinkedIn&#39;s notification system, a multi-quarter effort of designing and implementation that 
            had me working with multiple different teams across the entire tech stack from Ember, Java, HDFS, and Kafka. The infrastructure
            I built was in support of a machine learning anomoly detection engine that surfaces important events, such as 
            when a company experiences layoffs. My work was the template for the team and allowed future notifications and alerts to be iterated
            on quickly. Additionally, I:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Built the APIs that consumed anomaly events and the UIs to display them in-app
            </li>
            <li>
                Evangelized migrating to Octane and advocated for modern practices by putting them into practice. We were one of the first teams at LinkedIn to release 
                customer facing products using the new framework
            </li>
            <li>
                Designed a shareable read-only view of Talent Insights
            </li>
            <li>
                Built some of the first underlying React components for Recruiter. These components represented the core building blocks,
                such as buttons, icons, lists, etc. that would be used by future React apps
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Above all, my experience at LinkedIn taught me about <i>scale</i>. I&#39;m not just talking about building systems 
            for millions of users, but how to design systems and write code for an audience of 
            hundreds of Engineers. And even more importantly, I learned how to effectively communicate, work with, and get buy in from these
            hundereds of Engineers, Designers, and Product Managers, all across the globe.

        <h5>Taking control of the helm.</h5>

        <p>
            Most recently, I&#39;ve sat as a Principal Software Engineer at <a href="https://videoamp.com/">VideoAmp</a>. I was the Typescript Node
            subject-matter-expert, though I worked extensively across the tech stack with React, Go, Postgres, Snowflake, and Kafka.
        </p>

        <h4 class="util__no-header-bottom">As a Senior Software Engineer</h4>
        <p>
            I successfully evangelized and 
            then led the effort to re-architect Node microservices to meet the increase in load and quality expectations on the systems.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Led and mentored a team that, in less than twelve months, grew from four engineers to over a dozen
            </li>
            <li>
                Designed and built a new Node API that introduced stronger typings, a tighter architecture, and model validation
            </li>
            <li>
                Gave frequent talks to promote best practices, Code Review standards, and advocated for Typescript APIs 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The new system was delivered with zero downtime to users and we appraoched zero runtime alerts in the service when 
            deployed. Shortly after, I was a Tech Lead on a separate project for 
            <a href="https://videoamp.com/press/videoamp-to-measure-deduplicated-youtube-reach-and-frequency/">measuring YouTube</a> 
            that was to be built on top of the new system. Again the team was able to move fast and deliver with no user-facing issues - 
            proof that the new services were a success.
        </p>

        <h4 class="util__no-header-bottom">As a Principal Software Engineer</h4>
        <p>
            I took the learnings from those APIs and built new services which onboarded Typescript into the organization&#39;s new
            Bazel build system, where I focused on <i>creating the best developer experience imaginable</i>. Meanwhile, 
            this effort was really ancillary - I was leading a team to design and launch a <i>Report Templating Engine</i> 
            that would need to be built using these new tools. In three months I achieved both:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Typescript became a first-class supported programming language where I integrated 
                GRPC, static database types, model validation, and integrated into the release pipelines
            </li>
            <li>
                The engine was released on these new tools
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The responsibilities only grew from there. Following that project I:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Helped build a team of six engineers with the Engineering Manager. As the Lead,
                I was responsible for all Scrum ceremonies, architecture, scoping,
                and project planning. My day was largely spent mentoring and unblocking the team through relentlessly improving processes, and I 
                mostly got my hands dirty on the most difficult technical problems and designs
            </li>
            <li>
                Architected the <code>Platform 2.0</code> by integrating the acquired <a href="https://www.elsyglobal.com/">Elsy Platform</a> into VideoAmp.
                I oversaw the higher-level architecture of combining the APIs, UIs, and data models, while delegating lower-level designs to the team.
            </li>
            <li>
                Led the efforct for the company to adopt HTMX and OpenAPI tooling to power a Developer Portal for
                external API consumers. I pushed for the entire company to adopt RESTful API standards, defined our API lifecycle, and
                advocated for API Evolution
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This had been the most rewarding
            period of my career thus far. It was addictive to witness the team learn and grow, and I was satisfied with how
            the decisions I made began to impact the engineering organization as a whole.

        <h5>Let&#39;s get Started Up.</h5>

        <p>
            Bootstrapped(ing) an E-commerce startup <a href="https://herdbuy.com" target="_blank">HERDBUY.com &#8690;</a> with three college friends.
            I&#39;ve been focused on a few things:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Building. As the founding engineer, I am by definition extremely hands-on building out the infrastructure, backend Golang services, Postgres
                datastores, serverless Functions, and React user experiences
            </li>
            <li>
                Balancing technical decisions that allow us to quickly deliver <i>something</i> that is <b>valuable</b>. I&#39;ve cut multiple features,
                relied on manual processes until they don&#39;t scale, used
                off-the-shelf solutions where it made sense, and have built a LOT everywhere else (see above)
            </li>
            <li>
                Shaping the company strategy. I helped us re-focus on attacking a single market that we could later grow from or dominate the niche
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I&#39;ve been extremely energized from building HerdBuy. Pouring my time and energy into something, and seeing others enjoy and get value out of what I
            created, is one of the main reasons why I fell into software. Building a company is likely something I will continue to do in the foreseeable future, in one 
            form or another.
