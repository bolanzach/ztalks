        <h5>Published: 15.Sep.2024</h5>

        <h2>Food</h2>
        <div class="util__small-divider util__mb2"></div>

        <p>
            Let&#39;s open with a problem.
            You have some <code>Food</code> and you need to perform some action based on the type of food.
        </p>

        <z component="ts-types-food-if-else"></z>

        <p>
            While the code is delicious, it&#39;s not easily extensible.
            When a new <code>Food</code> type is added, the <i>developer</i> must remember to add a new conditional branch.
        </p>

        <p>
            Taking a traditional object-oriented approach, one could be polymorphic and abstract over the types with concrete implementations.
        </p>

        <z component="ts-types-food-oop"></z>

        <p>
            That is arguably more extensible at the expense of being a little overkill.
            In the first example it was kind of nice that we could just work with primitive values.
            Since we&#39;re talking about Typescript, these primitive objects work well within React, but also with more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-oriented_design">data-oriented architectures</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even worse, it&#39;s not always possible to create a nice class or object for each entity.
            What if you&#39;re receiving a <code>CustomerOrder</code> from a different service or an async (Kafka) event, and need to create dinner based on what is in the order?
            Argh! We&#39;re back to the if-else problem.
        </p>

        <z component="ts-types-food-if-else-order"></z>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <div class="util__small-divider util__mb2"></div>

        <p>
            Let&#39;s jump straight into what a better solution may look like.
        </p>

        <z component="ts-types-exhaustive-types"></z>

        <p>
            There (hopefully) shouldn&#39;t be any crazy new syntax here.
            And while this may look similar to the if-else example, and we&#39;re just using a regular object, the key insight is that <code>Record</code> type.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <code>Record&lt;K, V&gt</code> essentially turns our object into a mapping of <code>K : V</code>.
            This is immensely powerful because all possible permutations of <code>K</code> must be present in the map.
            <i>If there is a missing key, the Typescript compiler will throw an error.</i>
            When the keys are a <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types">discrete union type</a> or enum, we can ensure that all possible values of that type are considered in the map.
        </p>

        <p>
            So in our Food example, if we were to add a new Food type, we <i>MUST</i> add a new entry to the mapping.
        </p>

        <z component="ts-types-food-match-order-error"></z>

        <h3>Back to OOP</h3>

        <p>
            Let&#39;s revisit the <code>CustomerOrder</code> example.
            Maybe we do want to keep the <code>ingredients</code> within our <code>Food</code> because that seems to make sense.
            We can use a mapping, as a Factory method, to handle the creation of our Food based on the Order.
        </p>

        <z component="ts-types-food-match-order"></z>

        <p>
            A factory is a great way to integrate with some object-oriented approaches.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the advantages of the mapping is that it takes a more functional approach.
            By mapping values to values there can be multiple different maps throughout the codebase.
            Rather than force into a single object that knows how to handle all operations for a type, we can spread out concerns knowing that when a new type is added, the compiler will complain until all mapping instances are updated.
        </p>

        <z component="ts-types-food-match-mappings"></z>

        <h3>Conditionals</h3>

        <p>
            This is more or less a drop-in replacement for most switch statements.
            The mapping may be slightly more verbose than a switch because each case (<code>K</code> in the map) must be explicitly handled.
            I see that as a good thing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember, the map&#39;s values can be functions, allowing for more complex logic and branching.
            This allows us to use this pattern to replace many common if-else chains.
        </p>

        <z component="ts-types-match-fn"></z>

        <h2>Matrices</h2>
        <div class="util__small-divider util__mb2"></div>

        <p>
            Can we take it up a notch?
            This pattern works well as a replacement for switch statements and basic if-else (or really any conditionals), but often times the branching is multi-variable.
            For instance, say we have some Food and want to make a full Meal based on the food.
            Again, we&#39;re sent back to if-else.
        </p>

        <z component="ts-types-meal-if-else"></z>

        <p>
            What a mess!
            I know it&#39;s a rather silly example, but I have seen code that resembles this in most organizations I&#39;ve been a part of.
            I think part of the issue is that our traditional OOP fails to nicely encapsulate this kind of logic.
            We could maybe move this into some Factory or maybe use a Strategy pattern?
            But again, it feels like overkill.
            Let&#39;s try the mapping approach.
        </p>

        <z component="ts-types-matrix-1"></z>

        <p>
            As you might expect by now, there&#39;s that <code>Record</code> again.
            But the keys are a bit more complex.
            Using a <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/template-literal-types.html">template literal type</a>, we can create a new discrete union type that is a combination of <code>MainDish</code> and <code>SideDish</code>.
            And with exhaustive type checking, we can ensure that all possible combinations are handled.
            The above code will not actually compile because the mapping is not exhaustive.
            The expanded map will look like below.
        </p>

        <z component="ts-types-matrix-2"></z>

        <p>
            Now that is cool!
            Every possible permutation is covered.
            No more forgetting to add a new logic branch as new Dish types are added.
        </p>

        <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
        <div class="util__small-divider util__mb2"></div>

        <p>
            If you&#39;re working on a team (most of us are) and you want to try this out - show them.
            Don&#39;t just start replacing all your conditionals with mappings.
            Not only is this not idiomatic Typescript, it just <i>feels</i> different, and can invite pushback.
            Have a conversation and get buy-in from your team to find the places where this pattern makes sense.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my <i>personal</i> projects I leverage some additional abstractions that make the mappings feel more like pattern matching.
            I wouldn&#39;t recommend this for most teams, for the same reason retrofitting RxJS into a codebase doesn&#39;t make sense, but it&#39;s a fun exercise.
        </p>
