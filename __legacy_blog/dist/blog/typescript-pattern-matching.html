  <h1>Typescript Pattern Matching</h1>

  <h2>XXX</h2>

  <div class="blog__published-date">January 12, 2023</div>

  
      <p>
        Pattern matching is, in my opinion, one of the more powerful tools
        available to programmers. It's something that I first ran across when
        playing with Haskell and then later Rust. At this point, I'm not sure if
        I could be as productive in any language that doesn't support the
        feature in some form - it's that powerful. Coming from Typescript and
        never heard of it or don't know what I'm even talking about? No worries,
        I got you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Typescript doesn't support pattern matching as a first class feature so
        we're going to take some liberties. But that is somewhat of the point -
        we don't need to even flex Typescript much to start understanding the
        basics of pattern matching and how you can use a form of it in your
        code.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the
        <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html">Rust Book</a>, the general idea is that pattern matching

        <quote>
          allows you to compare a value against a series of patterns and then
          execute code based on which pattern matches.
        </quote>

        Said another way, matching is a control-flow construct that exhaustively
        maps from a value's shape to an expression or value. That may still be
        basically word vomit so let's break it down, using concepts from
        Typescript.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Control-flow:</i> Pattern matching is something like an
        <code class="blog__code">if/else</code> or a
        <code class="blog__code">switch</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Exhaustively maps:</i> It's a mapping, so we can express this
        statement as a Typescript object. The <i>exhaustive</i> part is a little
        more complex, but it has to do with the mapping object's keys. This is
        one of the most important concepts so we'll talk about this property in
        detail soon.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>[Maps] from a value's shape to an expression or value:</i> This means
        that the data's Type determines the mapping object's keys, and thus what
        we are allowed to "match" on. The values are an expression or some
        value.
      </p>

      <p>
        I know things may still be fuzzy but hang in there - I promise this will
        make sense! Nothing we're about to do is going to melt your mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        With this rough definiton we at least know that we can express a
        pattern-matching statement as an object in Typescript. Let's dive into a
        basic example to get our feet wet.
      </p>

      <pre class="code"><code>
  <span class="declaration">const</span> <span class="var-name">patternMatchBool</span> = {
    <span class="declaration">true</span>: <span class="string">"It's true"</span>,
    <span class="declaration">false</span>: <span class="string">"It's false"</span>
  };
  <span class="declaration">const</span> <span class="var-name">myBool</span> = true;
  <span class="declaration">const</span> <span class="var-name">matched</span> = <span class="var-name">patternMatchBool</span>[<span class="var-name">myBool</span>]; <span class="comment">// "It's true"</span>

</code></pre>

      <p>
        Believe it or not, that's it. I told you it doesn't look so bad! And
        it's all we need to do for some basic matching.
      </p>

      <p>
        But wait, couldn't this be expressed as a
        <code class="blog__code">switch</code> or
        <code class="blog__code">if/else</code>? In short, yes, it could be.
        Like I mentioned, pattern matching is just another control-flow
        statement and so it can often be used interchangably with the other more
        familiar statements. And honestly, between you and me, in this simple
        example it would be preferrable to do something like:
      </p>

      <pre class="code"><code>
  <span class="declaration">const</span> <span class="var-name">matched</span> = <span class="var-name">myBool</span>
    ? <span class="string">"It's true"</span>
    : <span class="string">"It's false"</span>;

</code></pre>

      <p>
        You're smart and you know it's coming so let's expand on the example.
        Instead of just booleans what if we're dealing with a set of known
        values - an Enum in Typescript. We know this is where
        <code class="blog__code">if/else</code> begins to fall short and there's
        entire books about how to avoid such travesties. Let's see how our
        pattern matching can start to handle such situations:
      </p>

      <pre class="code"><code>
  <span class="declaration">enum</span> <span class="var-name">Food</span> {
    <span class="declaration">Pizza</span>,
    <span class="declaration">Burrito</span>,
    <span class="declaration">Burger</span>,
  }

  <span class="declaration">const</span> <span class="var-name">FOOD_MATCHER</span> = {
    <span class="declaration">[</span>Food.Pizza<span class="declaration">]</span>: <span class="string">"Pizza party"</span>,
    <span class="declaration">[</span>Food.Burrito<span class="declaration">]</span>: <span class="string">"Burritos every weekend"</span>,
    <span class="declaration">[</span>Food.Burger<span class="declaration">]</span>: <span class="string">"Double patties"</span>,
  };

  <span class="declaration">const</span> <span class="var-name">myFood</span> = <span class="var-name">Food.Burrito</span>;
  <span class="declaration">const</span> <span class="var-name">matched</span> = <span class="var-name">FOOD_MATCHER</span>[<span class="var-name">myFood</span>]; <span class="comment">// "Burritos every weekend"</span>

</code></pre>

      <p>
        A little more complex but it's nothing you can't handle. Other than
        learning that I'm a fatass, you can start to see how the
        <i>data shape</i>, in this case the Enum of
        <code class="blog__code">Food</code>, dictates the
        <code class="blog__code">FOOD_MATCHER</code> object's keys. We'll
        continue to dive deeper into the <i>exhaustive</i> shortly, but for now
        you should notice that how every enum member is accounted for. Each
        <code class="blog__code">Food</code> item is mapped to a value.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ok Ok you're asking - but what about
        <code class="blog__code">switch</code>? You've been using that since you
        leared to crawl, and it seems like it would be appropriate here. And
        again, you're not totally incorrect. You <i>could</i> use it, but that's
        not what we're learning. And for all the love
        <code class="blog__code">switch</code> has gotten thanks to
        <i>Redux</i> it's missing the most important property of paattern
        matching - <i>exhaustive checking</i>. Since we're using Typescript
        let's update our above example with proper types.
      </p>

      <pre class="code"><code>
  <span class="declaration">enum</span> <span class="var-name">Food</span> {
    <span class="declaration">Pizza</span>,
    <span class="declaration">Burrito</span>,
    <span class="declaration">Burger</span>,
  }

  <span class="declaration">const</span> <span class="var-name">FOOD_MATCHER</span>: <i class="emphasis"><span class="interface">Record</span>&lt;<span class="var-name">Food</span>, <span class="var-name">string</span>&gt;</i> = {
    <span class="declaration">[</span>Food.Pizza<span class="declaration">]</span>: <span class="string">"Pizza party"</span>,
    <span class="declaration">[</span>Food.Burrito<span class="declaration">]</span>: <span class="string">"Burritos every weekend"</span>,
    <span class="declaration">[</span>Food.Burger<span class="declaration">]</span>: <span class="string">"Double patties"</span>,
  };

  <span class="declaration">const</span> <span class="var-name">myFood</span> = <span class="var-name">Food.Burrito</span>;
  <span class="declaration">const</span> <span class="var-name">matched</span> = <span class="var-name">FOOD_MATCHER</span>[<span class="var-name">myFood</span>]; <span class="comment">// "Burritos every weekend"</span>

</code></pre>

      <p>
        Adding type information unlocks the full power of pattern matching in
        Typescript (and in general). Our
        <code class="blog__code">FOOD_MATCHER</code> is now <i>required</i> to
        enumerate every member in <code class="blog__code">FOOD</code> or else
        we get errors at compile time. This is so powerful because it is
        impossible to forget to map a value when we add a new member to our
        enum.
      </p>

      <pre class="code"><code>
  <span class="declaration">enum</span> <span class="var-name">Food</span> {
    <span class="declaration">Pizza</span>,
    <span class="declaration">Burrito</span>,
    <span class="declaration">Burger</span>,
    <span class="declaration">Salad</span>,
  }

  <span class="error"><span class="declaration">const</span> <span class="var-name">FOOD_MATCHER</span>: <i><span class="interface">Record</span>&lt;<span class="var-name">Food</span>, <span class="var-name">string</span>&gt;</i></span> = {
    <span class="declaration">[</span>Food.Pizza<span class="declaration">]</span>: <span class="string">"Pizza party"</span>,
    <span class="declaration">[</span>Food.Burrito<span class="declaration">]</span>: <span class="string">"Burritos every weekend"</span>,
    <span class="declaration">[</span>Food.Burger<span class="declaration">]</span>: <span class="string">"Double patties"</span>,
  };

</code></pre>

      <p>
        Ewww the dreaded squiggly red underline! The
        <code class="blog__code">FOOD_MATCHER</code> has a missing property and
        we cannot compile. Thus this satisfies our
        <i>exhaustive type checking</i> as every value in our data shape must be
        accounted for.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point I'm hoping you're seeing how this all works but let's
        start pulling it all together and cleaning things thing up.
      </p>

      <pre class="code"><code>
  <span class="declaration">const</span> <span class="var-name">myFood</span>: <span class="interface">Food</span> = <span class="var-name">Food.Burrito</span>;

  <span class="declaration">const</span> <span class="var-name">foodMessage</span> = {
    <span class="declaration">[</span>Food.Pizza<span class="declaration">]</span>: () =&gt; <span class="string">"Pizza party"</span>,
    <span class="declaration">[</span>Food.Burrito<span class="declaration">]</span>: () =&gt; <span class="string">"Burritos every weekend"</span>,
    <span class="declaration">[</span>Food.Burger<span class="declaration">]</span>: () =&gt; <span class="string">"Double patties"</span>,
    <span class="declaration">[</span>Food.Salad<span class="declaration">]</span>: () =&gt; <span class="string">"For decoration"</span>,
  }[myFood](); <span class="comment">// "Burritos every weekend"</span>

</code></pre>

      <p>
        Rather than just mapping to string literals (or any other static values)
        we can map to a function or an <i>expression</i>. This is our
        <i>flow of control</i> and allows us to take specific actions based on
        the incoming data shape.
      </p>

      <pre class="code"><code>
  <span class="declaration">type</span> <span class="interface">PatternMatch</span> = <i>&lt;<span class="var-name">T</span> <span class="declaration">extends</span> <span class="interface">string | number</span>, <span class="var-name">U</span>&gt;(
    val: <span class="var-name">T</span>,
    matcher: <span class="interface">Record</span>&lt;<span class="var-name">T</span>, () =&gt; <span class="var-name">U</span>&gt;
  ): () =&gt; <span class="var-name">U</span></i>;

  <span class="comment">// You can implement this yourself</span>
  <span class="declaration">const</span> <span class="func">match</span>: <i><span class="interface">PatternMatch</span></i> = ...

  <span class="declaration">const</span> <span class="var-name">foodMessage</span> = <span class="func">match</span>(<span class="var-name">myFood</span>, {
    <span class="declaration">[</span>Food.Pizza<span class="declaration">]</span>: () =&gt; <span class="string">"Pizza party"</span>,
    <span class="declaration">[</span>Food.Burrito<span class="declaration">]</span>: () =&gt; <span class="string">"Burritos every weekend"</span>,
    <span class="declaration">[</span>Food.Burger<span class="declaration">]</span>: () =&gt; <span class="string">"Double patties"</span>,
    <span class="declaration">[</span>Food.Salad<span class="declaration">]</span>: () =&gt; <span class="string">"For decoration"</span>,
  });
